# Sales Performance & Operations Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance, pricing behavior, and delivery efficiency using **SQL (MySQL)** and **Power BI (Web)**.  
The goal is to provide an executive-level view of revenue drivers while also uncovering operational and pricing insights that impact profitability and customer experience.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains transactional sales records with:
- Order and delivery dates
- Products and quantities sold
- Unit prices, discounts, and shipping costs
- Salesperson, store location, region
- Customer type (Retail / Wholesale)

Time coverage spans **2023–2025**, enabling trend and growth analysis.

- **Average Wait Time (Days)**

### Page 2 – Pricing & Operations
- **Number of Products**
- **Total Discount**
- **Average Shipping Cost**
- **Customer Type (Retail / Wholesale slicer)**

## Key Insights

### Revenue & Performance
- Sales are **well distributed across regions and salespeople**, reducing dependency risk.
- Tablets, laptops, and printers generate the highest total revenue.
- 2024 showed positive year-over-year growth, while 2025 results reflect partial-year data.

### Pricing & Product Mix
- Some products exhibit **low volume but high revenue**, indicating premium pricing potential.
- Average unit price varies meaningfully with quantity, highlighting different pricing strategies across products.
- Discounts are concentrated in specific products, signaling margin pressure areas.

### Operations & Delivery
- Average delivery wait time is approximately **6 days**.
- Only **44% of orders** are delivered within 5 days, highlighting an opportunity for logistics improvement.
- Shipping costs vary by product and correlate with pricing behavior for certain items.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL)** — data cleaning, aggregation, EDA
- **Power BI (Web)** — interactive dashboards and KPIs
- **DAX** — calculated measures (delivery metrics, rates, averages)

## Dashboard Structure
- **Page 1:** Executive overview (sales, trends, performance)
- **Page 2:** Operational & pricing analysis (discounts, shipping, customer type)

---

## Business Value
This dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Identify top revenue drivers and concentration risks
- Understand pricing vs volume trade-offs
- Monitor delivery efficiency without relying on assumed SLA dates
- Support data-driven decisions in sales, pricing, and operations

---

## Notes
- Due to the absence of a promised delivery date, delivery performance is evaluated using **actual wait time** and a **fast-delivery threshold**, ensuring metrics remain objective and defensible.
